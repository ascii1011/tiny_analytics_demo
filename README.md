## Warning
This repository is meant to be a demo to show talent only and not meant for production use.
Use at your own risk.

## Purpose of this project
Is to showcase a good portion of my abilities by working through a project at all levels.
So, it will be a project within a project.

## My approach
Because I will be the client as well as the staff that brings the project to life, I am 
going to try to keep this as simple as possible as things can spiral quickly.

I will start off with: We somehow have a client wanting a solution.
We will start with a client giving an elevator type of outline as it can tell a lot about
the expectations. 

## client outline 
"A flexible project that provides insights into my management, 
design, archectural, and coding abilities."


After meeting with the client(myself) I gather requirements at still a high level

## client requirements
 - keep cost extremely low
 - a small analytics platform based in AWS
 - Should be able to test ETL jobs.
 - ignore historical element for now
 - target audience: Recruiters, engineers, and even CTOs


Note:
The basic tech stack will compose of at least Apache Airflow, Python, Bash & AWS services.
Tenant based workflow architecture, Security, resiliency, scalability, big data stores, and 
advanced queries or analytics may be added later.
 
## specifications
 - Cloud platform: Amazon AWS
 - ETL Scheduler: Apache Airflow + DB AWS image
 - Staging image for translation and processing of workflows

## Roles
A translation of the specifications could be broken down to the following roles:

### PMP guildlines
 - Use open source and off the shelf solutions unless unable to
 - Possibly use clickup.com as the project management.
 - Possibly use Jenkins as CICD tool.

### Platform Engineer duties
 - AWS environment
 - Database
 - CICD process

### Data Engineer duties
 - create build/deployment of airflow AWS
 - Create ETL workflows orchestration

### Software Engineer duties
 - create libraries and extensions for workflows, security, and access









## Alternative Considerations:

My approach here is different from real-world sitautions.

Requirements and expectations can be vastly different as expression of thoughts differ 
from actual available techical solutions.

In real client-facing project scenarios can vary wildly in the process and ideally would 
be over the course of 3 or more meetings with stakeholders.  Initial meetings involve a meet and greet
allowing everyone to establish high level (or more) understanding of the expectations and how to communicate.

This may result in an estimate being provided that the client agrees they are in line with.

Additional meetings are likely to be intensely more technical to get well defined specifications.

Which lead into logistics of bringing those specifications to a successful project efficacy stage.  
Logistics of how the projects success is measured can get further broken down into budgetting, 
division of labor, and project processes (Scrum, Waterfall, etc...)
