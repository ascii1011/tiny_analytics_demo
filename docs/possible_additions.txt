The following is a list of possible paths for expansion

solution backed topics:
 - S3 in place of 
    - hdfs for injection entry point
    - hive as staging 

Workflow ideas:
 - basic best routing (A*/Dijkstra)
 - basic best sentiment
 - basic best dimensions
 - specific targetting, decision, and reaction
    - use nlp for 
        - political sentiment
        - location
        - affiliation
        - graphql db
        - extract geospacial targets 
    - use ML/AI for best response
    resulting in:
         - predictive geospatical paths
         - grading and course of actions
         - diplay real time weighted relationships


special case coding:
 - [flexibility,efficiency] create simple rust exec to parse/filter lines in well defined csv file
 - [high level architecture, abstraction, reusability] create tenantized tmplated approach to dags
 - [real use case workflow step] use bash to make calls with ansible/socket to staging image to call rust exec
  



additional aspects to consider enhancing at a later point:
Security (AWS IAM, Airflow auth)

Data stores:
 - RDS, Redshift, DynamoDB

Resiliency:
 - the use of RDS, loadbalancers and other services would be nice

Scalability:
 - unfortuntely with time and cost contraints it is probably not feasable to host features like: 
        - Building out Airflow scheduler and workers within kubernetes on EKS
        - Backing it properly with RDS or Redshift
        - using Lambda for are a bit out of scope at the moment.
